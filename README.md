Machine learning project Pawpularity 

## Layout repository
In this repository you can find the code, data, and report for the Pawpularity assignment. 

The code can be found in /code. For each of the milestones we created a separate folder. In this folder you can find the code per chapter, as well as the final code for that milestone, which is named Milestone_x. 

The data can be found in the petfinder-pawpularity-score. There are three csv files containing the tabular data for training and testing. The sample submission files contains the pawpularity score for the test data. There are two folders, containing the images for training or testing. 

The report can be found in /docs. There is a version per milestone as well as the final version of the report. In this folder you can also find the pdf of the presentation.

## How to use code
The code should be executed in Google Colab. Since Google Colab is used, self made functions cannot be imported and each notebook contains the full code for the model.
