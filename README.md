Machine learning project Pawpularity of Cass Maes, Bente van Katwijk, Demi Soetens en Ilse Feenstra

In this repository you can find the code, data, and report for the Pawpularity assignment. 

The code can be found in /code. For each of the milestones we created a separate folder. In this folder you can find the code per chapter, as well as the final code for that milestone, which is named Milestone_x. There is also a folder which contains older versions of code (/Old_versions), which are not used anymore. 

The data can be found in the petfinder-pawpularity-score. There are three csv files containing the tabular data for training and testing. The sample submission files contains the pawpularity score for the test data. There are two folders, containing the images for training or testing. 

The report can be found in /docs. There is a version per milestone as well as the final version of the report. In /docs/images, the images used in each chapter can be found.
