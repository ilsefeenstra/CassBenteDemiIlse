Machine learning project Pawpularity of Cass Maes, Bente van Katwijk, Demi Soetens and Ilse Feenstra.

In this repository you can find the code, data, and report for the Pawpularity assignment. 

The code can be found in /code. For each of the milestones we created a separate folder. In this folder you can find the code per chapter, as well as the final code for that milestone, which is named Milestone_x. Since we used google colab, we could not import our own functions in the notebook, so each notebook contains the full code for the model.

The data can be found in the petfinder-pawpularity-score. There are three csv files containing the tabular data for training and testing. The sample submission files contains the pawpularity score for the test data. There are two folders, containing the images for training or testing. 

The report can be found in /docs. There is a version per milestone as well as the final version of the report. In this folder you can also find the pdf of the presentation.
